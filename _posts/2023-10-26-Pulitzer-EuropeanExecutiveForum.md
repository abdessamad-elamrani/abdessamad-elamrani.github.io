At the eSentire European Executive Forum held at the Pulitzer Hotel in Amsterdam, I had the privilege of participating as a speaker among senior leaders from MSPs across the Benelux region. The event, sponsored by eSentire and hosted by Phil Skelton, focused on the evolving cybersecurity landscape, emphasizing the integration of advanced technologies like AI and machine learning in Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services.

During my talk, I highlighted the critical need for strategic partnerships to address the rising sophistication of cyber threats and the cybersecurity skill gap. I discussed how MSPs can leverage collaborations with specialized providers to enhance their service offerings and meet regulatory compliance requirements, such as GDPR and NIS2.

The round table also provided a platform for discussing the challenges of differentiating services in a competitive market and the importance of investing in cybersecurity infrastructure. I shared insights on how digital transformation and regulatory pressures are driving the demand for robust cybersecurity measures.

Overall, the event underscored the importance of innovation and collaboration in navigating the complexities of the cybersecurity market, offering valuable insights into future trends and strategic opportunities.

Since this was top executives round table, for privacy reason I will not share pictures from inside the round table event.
