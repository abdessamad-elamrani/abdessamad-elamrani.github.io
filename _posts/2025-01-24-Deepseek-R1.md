## Open Source vs. Non-Open Source LLMs: Clearing the Confusion

The release of **DeepSeek R1** has reignited discussions around *open source* Large Language Models (LLMs). The excitement it generated in the IT world led many developers to assume that the model is fully “open source.” However, in the context of LLMs, “open source” has nuances that differ significantly from traditional software development. Below, we untangle these nuances, clarify misconceptions, and discuss what truly goes into building a Large Language Model.

---

## 1. Traditional Open Source vs. “Open” LLMs

In *traditional open source* software:
- The **source code** is freely available for anyone to view, modify, or distribute.  
- This includes compilation instructions and any dependencies.  

In the context of **“open source” LLMs**:
- Many models are released under licenses allowing research or commercial use.  
- The **trained weights** are published, so researchers can download and run the model.  
- However, the **underlying training data**, **training scripts**, and **infrastructure details** (e.g., GPU clusters) are often *not* included.  

This distinction means that even though you can download and use the weights, you cannot trivially re-create or re-train the model from scratch. Therefore, calling such an LLM “open source” can be misleading if the complete training setup is not fully disclosed.

---

## 2. Why Access to Weights Alone Isn’t Enough

1. **Proprietary or Private Datasets**  
   LLMs typically require massive datasets curated from multiple sources. Many of these sources are under restrictive licenses, or are proprietary internal data dumps.  
   - Simply possessing the final weights does not give you insight into precisely which data points the model was exposed to.  
   - You can’t easily replicate or alter the training process without the original dataset.

2. **Training Software and Scripts**  
   While some organizations release partial training code, the exact scripts used may include domain-specific logic, custom distributed-training setups, hyperparameters, or other tweaks that remain hidden.  
   - Differences in libraries, hardware accelerators, or data-parallel strategies can dramatically change the outcomes.  
   - Without the full environment configuration, re-creating the model’s training process is non-trivial.

3. **Infrastructure Requirements**  
   Training modern LLMs is resource-intensive, needing massive GPU clusters or specialized hardware.  
   - Even if you had the same data and scripts, you might not have the multi-million-dollar setup to replicate the results.  
   - This leads many “open” models to be effectively un-replicable, as owners do not provide the required compute environment.

## 3. The DeepSeek R1 Release and the “Open” Hype

DeepSeek R1 was announced with much fanfare, with enthusiasts labeling it as a fully open-source LLM. However:
- The **weight files** were made publicly downloadable under a permissive license.  
- The actual **training data** remains under NDA or proprietary contracts.  
- **Training details**—such as hyperparameters, data augmentation pipelines, and custom code—are not publicly disclosed.  

Hence, while developers can experiment with DeepSeek R1’s inference and finetune certain aspects of the model, they cannot fully *retrain* or *verify* the training steps that led to these weights. It’s more accurate to call DeepSeek R1 a *model with openly available weights* rather than a strictly open source project.

## 4. Implications for the LLM Community

1. **Innovation and Transparency**  
   - Publicly released weights spur innovation for downstream tasks (e.g., domain-specific finetuning).  
   - However, limited visibility into data quality and distribution can lead to biases that are hard to diagnose.

2. **Reproducibility**  
   - Strict definitions of open source in machine learning emphasize reproducibility.  
   - Without full disclosure of data, code, and environment, thorough reproducibility is nearly impossible.

3. **Commercial vs. Community**  
   - Commercially funded organizations may partially open certain aspects to gain community adoption, while still protecting trade secrets or proprietary data.  
   - Fully open source communities (e.g., some academic labs) aim to release everything, but often face funding or resource constraints that limit large-scale training.

## 5. How to Build (and Share) LLMs More Transparently

1. **Provide *All* Training Artifacts**  
   - Publish the data sources, licensing details, data preprocessing steps, and data sampling strategies, where feasible.  
   - Release training scripts, hyperparameters, environment configurations, and any custom libraries used.

2. **Document the Infrastructure**  
   - Include details about hardware setups, networking calibration, and memory usage.  
   - This may not fully mitigate cost barriers, but aids reproducibility and clarity for other researchers.

3. **Use Clear Licensing**  
   - If the project is truly open source, use established licenses (e.g., Apache 2.0, MIT) that guarantee reuse and distribution rights.  
   - If there are restrictions, label them transparently (e.g., “weights available under research-only license”).

4. **Encourage Community Contributions**  
   - Allow users to inspect and modify training code.  
   - Provide channels (like GitHub issues, forums) for questions, bug reports, and improvements.

## 6. Conclusion

While downloading and running LLM weights is *invaluable*, it does not necessarily equate to having a fully open source solution. Access to the weights alone omits essential pieces: the training data, complete software stack, and often the specialized infrastructure required to reproduce or substantially modify the model’s train-time behavior.

With the buzz around releases like *DeepSeek R1*, it’s important to be precise about what “open” really means. Clarity about the scope of openness fosters healthier collaboration, avoids overblown expectations, and guides the community toward truly transparent and reproducible AI research.
