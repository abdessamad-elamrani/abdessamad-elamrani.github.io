`Event Recap: Digital Transformation in the Energy Sector Forum 2023, Amsterdam, The Netherlands `

<br>
On June 5th, 2023, I had the privilege of speaking at a significant event in Amsterdam, focusing on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and energy efficiency. This event brought together industry leaders and innovators to discuss the transformative impact of AI and IoT on the energy sector.
During my presentation, titled "Artificial Intelligence and IoT: Revolutionizing the Energy Efficiency Sector," I explored the potential of smart technologies to optimize energy consumption across various sectors. Drawing from my extensive experience with top tech vendors like Fortinet and Palo Alto Networks, I highlighted the challenges and opportunities in industrial, transportation, residential, and commercial energy optimization.
A key focus was on the residential sector, where substantial energy waste occurs due to inefficient appliances and systems. I shared insights on how smart home technologies, such as sensors and home automation management systems, can significantly reduce energy waste. By leveraging AI-driven solutions, we can transform traditional homes into energy-efficient smart homes, addressing issues like vampire power and inefficient heating.
Furthermore, I addressed the energy dilemma associated with AI, emphasizing the environmental concerns of training large-scale AI models. I discussed the role of hyperscale data centers and the need for balancing technological advancement with sustainability.
The event was a fantastic opportunity to connect with fellow technologists and share my vision for a more sustainable future powered by AI and IoT. I am grateful for the chance to contribute to this important dialogue and look forward to continuing to drive innovation in this space.
