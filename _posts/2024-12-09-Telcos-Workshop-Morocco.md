`Great Workshops for INWI & Orange telcos in Morocco`

I'm happy to share about the amazing workshops we recently held in Morocco. My amazing colleague Kim Frellsen joined me as we met with teams from INWI and Orange, along with our  great local Fortinet team. Together, we explored some really exciting developments in technology and security.

## 5G Security: Building a Safer Future

5G is changing everything in telecom, and that means we need to think differently about security. Kim kicked things off by sharing some really important points:

- What makes 5G networks more vulnerable to attacks and why we need to pay attention
- Smart ways to keep 5G infrastructure safe and prevent security problems
- How Fortinet's security tools can help protect these modern networks

## Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): Insights into Network Traffic

I got to dive deep into the latest TLS developments and the challenges telecom operators face with DPI. If you're curious about these challenges, check out our webfiltering writeup or the TLS ECH animation.

(Note: Some details about our DPI solution are Fortinet proprietary, so I can't share everything here.)

## Quantum Computing and Cryptography: Preparing for the Next Era

Quantum computing is going to change cybersecurity in big ways. We talked about:

- Where quantum computing is now and where it's heading
- How it might affect our current encryption methods
- Ways we can prepare by using quantum-resistant encryption

## Fortinet: A Trusted Partner in Security

Throughout our sessions, we showed how Fortinet can help:

- Creating security solutions specifically for telecom companies
- Sharing real examples of our technology making a difference
- Showing how we're ready to tackle new challenges in 5G, DPI, and more

## Working Together for the Future

These workshops were about more than just sharing information - they were about working together to build something better. By talking directly with the people running these networks, we could help Moroccan telecom operators prepare for what's coming next in our digital world. It was great to share ideas and think about solutions together.

Thank you to everyone who helped make these workshops so successful, especially Youness Fikhar our main local SE in the telco market, Youssef Fouzi our great Morocco country manager, Mohammed El Kadiri, and all local Fortinet team. 

Looking forward to our next collaboration!
