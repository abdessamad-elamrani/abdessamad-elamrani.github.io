`Learning and Sharing at Our Annual Telco Workshop`

It's always exciting when we get together for our yearly Telco workshop! This time around, I had the chance to share some really interesting topics with our Telco SE team, especially diving into some tricky areas like Quality of Service (QoS) and how we test our solutions.

Here are the cool things we covered:

## Session 1: Making Sense of Telco and QoS Challenges

The QoS session was really fun and packed with useful information. We got into the nitty-gritty of traffic flows and how things work at the chip level, plus we looked at kernel QoS, how to design it right, and what problems to watch out for.

I loved how engaged everyone was - there were lots of great questions throughout! What made me really happy was how many engineers came up to me afterward to talk about their QoS projects in the Telco market. Seeing all this interest has got me thinking about writing a more detailed internal guide about it.

## Session 2: Real-World Experience with Fortinet Solutions

For the solutions testing session, I joined my manager, Simon Bryden, we had a great time sharing what we've learned from testing and validating solutions in the real world. We wrapped up with some funny stories from our field experiences, which was a nice way to end things on a lighter note.
