`Digital Transformation in the Energy Sector Forum 2023, Amsterdam`

<br>
I was excited to speak at an interesting event in Amsterdam this June, where we focused on how AI is changing the energy sector. It was great to meet other innovators who are working on making energy systems smarter and more efficient.

I also highlighted new AI technologies that help build  effective machine-learning energy-management models, and integrate directly into energy open source platforms. These community-driven solutions allow for tailored automations and easier integrations, ultimately helping us pinpoint and address energy waste more precisely.

We also had an important discussion about AI itself. While AI is amazing at solving problems, training big AI models actually uses a lot of energy. We talked about data centers and how to balance using new technology while being environmentally responsible.

It was really valuable to connect with others who care about making our energy use smarter and more sustainable. I'm looking forward to seeing how we can keep pushing these ideas forward.
