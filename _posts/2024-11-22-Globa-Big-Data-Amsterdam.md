`Event Recap: Big Data Digital Transformation Nov 2024, Amsterdam, The Netherlands `

Iâ€™m thrilled to share that I recently had the opportunity to host an engaging workshop in Amsterdam, exploring the transformative power of Big Data, Machine Learning, and the latest applications of emerging technologies. 

From discussing the evolution of Big Data technologies like Apache Spark and Kafka to diving into real-world Machine Learning applications in predictive analytics and anomaly detection, we explored how these innovations are shaping industries like telecommunications, retail, and energy optimization.

A big takeaway? The future of technology is not just in the tools we develop, but in how we use them to transform lives and industries.
