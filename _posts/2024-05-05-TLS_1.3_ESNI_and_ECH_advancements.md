`Implications of TLS 1.3, ESNI, DoH/ECH, QUIC and HTTP/3 on Network Security`

## Introduction

In the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, recent years have seen significant
advancements in web encryption protocols, notably with the widespread adoption of
TLS 1.3, the introduction of Encrypted Server Name Indication (ESNI), the transition
from ESNI to Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), and the deployment of HTTP/3.

These technologies collectively mark a major shift in how user data is protected online.
The introduction of these technologies, however, presents a complex set of challenges
for network security monitoring and particularly web-filtering.

Hence, the target of this document is to provide a valuable resource that explains these
new technologies, the challenges they present, and specifically how Fortigate handles
network security and web-filtering for each of these technologies.

Please note that for each technology, we will mainly be focusing on the changes that
directly impact the Network Security perspective, like SNI, CN, Key-shares, new
ESNI/ECH DNS records, DoH, but not on other improvements or changes related to the
Application Layer, speed, or other optimizations not related to security (such as
multiplexing, session-resume ..)

## TLS1.2 vs TLS1.3 and Web-Filtering

### WebFiltering in TLS 1.2

####  TLS 1.2 Exchange and Interesting Fields for Web Filtering

TLS 1.2 (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic network protocol designed to
provide secure communication over a computer network.
In the context of web filtering, two important fields are traditionally used by network
security middleboxes: the Server Name Indication (SNI) and the Certificate Common
Name (Certificate CN).

SNI allows the client to specify the hostname it is attempting to connect to at the start
of the handshake process, enabling the server to present the correct certificate.
The Certificate CN is part of the server's digital certificate, which is used to verify the
server's identity.

Both the SNI and Certificate CN are transmitted in clear text during the TLS handshake,
making them accessible for inspection and filtering by network security devices,
despite the encrypted communication channel established by TLS 1.2.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-05-TLS_1.3_esni_and_ECH_advancements/TLS-11.2-with-DH.png">

Here couple of things that will interests us to discuss:

Here are a few points of interest for our discussion:

- There are two main round trips required for the TLS exchange to finish and begin
encrypting/decrypting data: the first one highlighted in blue, and the second in
green.

- To generate the final cryptographic keys, the server first sends its part of the base
key share in the first blue round trip, while the client sends its part in the green
round trip.

- Besides the cryptographic keys, the TLS fields of interest from a Network Security
perspective, highlighted in red, are:

    1. **SNI**: Server Name Indication
    2. **CN**: Common Name field inside the Certificate.

These are the fields typically used by middlebox security devices to decide about the
domain to which the client is connecting.

It's clear that SNI and CN are not encrypted and are rather in cleartext, which is what
the Fortigate uses to make a web-filtering decision.

#### An inside look to packet-capture 

Throughout this document, we will be showing packet captures that are pre-decrypted,
in order to give visibility to the reader about the concepts we explain. An annex at the
end of this document provides instructions for readers who wish to capture packets and
perform the same exercises.

For instance, in the following figure, we can see the SNI in a typical TLS 1.2 exchange in
clear text and not protected (encrypted).


<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-05-TLS_1.3_esni_and_ECH_advancements/TLS1.2-SNI-cleartext-wireshark.png">


In the following figure, the Common Name (CN) is also displayed in clear text:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-05-TLS_1.3_esni_and_ECH_advancements/TLS1.2-CN-cleartext-wireshark.png">

#### Next Generation Firewalls and SNI in TLS1.2

As explained earlier, SNI in TLS 1.2 is in clear text, as well as the CN fields, hence typically next generation firewalls will use that to perform web-filtering security, by looking on the SNI field and understand the domain being visited by the user.

That being said, as a summary, even though TLS 1.2 encrypts all data exchanges, it
presents no challenges for middlebox network security devices, as the SNI and CN are
still exchanged in clear text.


### TLS 1.3: A Leap Forward in Security, but not an issue for typical Next Generation Firewalls.

#### TLS 1.3 exchange and interesting new changes


TLS 1.3 represents the latest iteration in the evolution of internet security protocols,
designed to provide secure communication between web browsers and servers. It
introduces several key improvements over its predecessor, TLS 1.2. Great resources
that explain these in detail can be found online, for instance in RFC 8446.
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446.

In this document, we will only focus on the key elements that specifically impact a
network security device performing web-filtering.

First, let's start with the TLS 1.3 typical exchange :


<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-05-TLS_1.3_esni_and_ECH_advancements/TLS1.3-exchange.png">


- With TLS 1.3, the Client Keyshare is sent immediately from the very first packet
(Client Hello).
- Already in the response of the first round trip (indicated in blue), the Server can
start encryption as soon as it shares its Keyshare, having all cryptographic
elements to generate the final encryption and decryption keys.
- What's also very interesting from a web-filtering perspective is that while the CN,
which is part of the Certificate, is protected by encryption, the SNI, however, is
still in clear text because it's part of the first ClientHello message.
- A final observation is that data exchange can immediately happen after the first
round trip (indicated in green) since it can be appended in the same final
Finished TLS message, hence offering a speed advantage compared to TLS 1.2,
which requires two round trips before starting encryption and data exchange.


That being said, despite TLS 1.3 oWering improvements in terms of speed and other
aspects we agreed not to touch upon in this document (such as hardening the list of
encryption cipher suites, session resumption, downgrade attack prevention, etc.), the
main part that interests us is that TLS 1.3 does not protect the SNI field. Hence, firewalls
or middleboxes performing web-filtering can continue to utilize the SNI field for
traditional web-filtering.

#### An inside look to packet-capture and web-filtering in Fortigate

Let's dive into a decrypted packet capture of TLS 1.3 to illustrate previous observations:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-05-TLS_1.3_esni_and_ECH_advancements/TLS1.3-packetcap.png">

We can observe the SNI in clear text, intentionally highlighting the fact that the ALPN
field, which is a TLS field indicating which L7 protocol will be running over TLS later, is
also in clear text. This field is important to highlight as we reach the ESNI / ECH section


#### Next Generation Firewalls and TLS1.3

Since the TLS 1.3 SNI field is still in clear text, Next Generation firewalls can still perform web-filtering without issues, even though the CN field is now encrypted.

As a summary for this chapter, TLS 1.3 improved the security of TLS exchanges by
enabling early encryption of TLS messages as soon as the Server Hello is received.
This allowed the protection of the CN field in the TLS Certificate. 

However, since the SNI is sent in the very first Client Hello message, this information can still be used by network security devices to perform web-filtering.


## ESNI , ECH and DoH , secure the last remaining leak in TLS ?

### ESNI , the first step toward an encrypted SNI , but not taken !

#### TLS 1.3 exchange and interesting new changes

ESNI represents an intermediate step toward complete handshake protection,
encrypting the Server Name Indication (SNI) field only in the TLS handshake to prevent
observers from determining which website a user is visiting. However, ESNI has
drawbacks and limitations, such as not encrypting other potentially revealing
information within the client hello, like the ALPN that we previously illustrated in the
packet capture. Challenges related to DNS and DoH also accompany ESNI.

Thus, ESNI became quickly outdated and is scarcely used in browsers or websites
today. Nonetheless, understanding ESNI is crucial for grasping ECH later on.
ESNI comes also with some challenges related to DNS, and DoH.

Letâ€™s see the typical TLS1.3 exchange with ESNI extension:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-05-TLS_1.3_esni_and_ECH_advancements/TLS1.3-with-ESNI.png">


As you might have noticed, the TLS1.3 exchange is exactly the same, with the exception
that SNI is encrypted immediately in first packet (Client Hello).

This raises the question here is: how the client was able to encrypt SNI before
exchanging any keys with the server ?
The answer lies in DNS: to enable early SNI encryption, a new *_esni* record type was
introduced, allowing ESNI-capable servers to publish a DNS record with their public
key, thus enabling the client to encrypt the SNI.

This new record was defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni-
02 , and in summary will be in this format:

  **_esni.example.com 60S IN TXT â€˜..key..â€™**


#### DNS and ESNI

As explained in previous paragraph, to facilitate SNI early encryption, client resolves
serverâ€™s public key via new DNS _esni record, below an illustration via packet capture :

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-05-TLS_1.3_esni_and_ECH_advancements/DNS_AND_esni.png">

We can see the DNS query to resolve the keys of bugs.wireshark.org website, and the
response with cryptographic keys below it.

#### DoH , secure the last leak

As explained earlier, ESNI relies on DNS to get the key , however, an interesting question
here is , a network observer might be able to learn the target domain by just looking at
DNS instead of looking at the TLS exchange which is now secures SNI.

Hence the solution for that is to encrypt DNS itself.
ESNI depends on DNS to obtain the key. However, a network observer could potentially
learn the target domain by examining DNS queries instead of the TLS exchange, which
now secures the SNI. The solution is to encrypt DNS itself. DoH (DNS over HTTPS),
defined in RFC 8484, encrypts DNS queries, enhancing privacy and security by
preventing target domain monitoring , or manipulation of DNS data via man-in-the-
middle attacks.

DoH sends DNS queries over HTTPS, ensuring encryption alongside normal web traWic,
complementing ESNI or its successor, ECH (Encrypted Client Hello), by protecting both
the content of web communications and the initial DNS lookup.

There are publicly available, well-known DoH providers that oWer DNS over HTTPS, such
as Cloudflare's DNS servers or NextDNS. As of the time of writing of this document,
DoH is typically configured at the browser layer, not yet at the OS layer, unlike traditional
DNS.

Here is an example of the configuration from Firefox, if you want to ensure DoH always
used, choose â€˜Max Protectionâ€™ and select one of the DoH servers available.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-05-TLS_1.3_esni_and_ECH_advancements/firefox-DNS-over-HTTPS-config.png">


#### Summary for ESNI extension

As a quick summary about ESNI, even though it was an interesting way to address the
SNI leak issue, however it was still allowing other parts in ClientHello still clear text (like
ALPN) which can still be beneficial to network observer to know. But also ESNI comes
with backward compatibility issues with TLS and browsers,

ESNI, despite being an interesting solution to the SNI leak issue, nonetheless allowed
other parts of the ClientHello, such as ALPN, to remain in clear text.

ESNI also encountered compatibility issues with TLS1.2, browsers and servers, quickly
becoming obsolete in favor of the introduction of ECH. Although ECH still incorporates
many mechanisms and ideas from ESNI, we won't be providing any tests from Fortigate,
because nowadays almost no client or server supports ESNI.


## Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)

### ECH introduction and exchange

ECH marks a significant advancement in web encryption technology, enhancing user
privacy by encrypting the entire client hello message during the TLS handshake.

This prevents network security intermediate devices from gaining insights into user
activities by monitoring the SNI, ALPN, or CN values, addressing a the remaining gap left
by ESNI.

Let's examine a typical TLS 1.3 exchange with ECH:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-05-TLS_1.3_esni_and_ECH_advancements/ECH-exchange.png">

Important observations :

- ECH works alongside DoH for the reasons we mentioned earlier in ESNI section,
the diWerence is for ECH, a new DNS record type **65** (HTTPS record) is
introduced, instead of **_esni** record.
- The DNS response contains the ECH Config, which includes the server's public
key, preparing the client for Client Hello encryption.
- Unlike the standard Client Hello, with ECH, two ClientHellos are embedded in
the same TLS client message: the outer one in clear text, typically holding the
CDN client-facing ECH server's SNI, and the inner encrypted private ClientHello
containing the actual target website's SNI.
- Remaining part of the exchange is similar to TLS1.3


#### Packet capture look and Fortigate handling

To capture and observe the DoH and TLS 1.3 ECH flow, certain preparations are
necessary, such as :

- Upgrade Wireshark to the latest version for ECH support,
- Use Firefox for its reliable ECH implementation
- Configure Firefox to enforce DoH
- Reduce DNS TTL in firefox, for capturing the DNS over HTTPS exchange.

Details on these preparations are in the last section.

For now, lets dig directly into the packet capture,

Using https://defo.ie/ech-check.php , a test website supporting ECH, allows us to
distinguish between the Outer and Inner SNI.

The website helps identify the TLS version used and shows the CDN client-facing server
(cover.defo.ie) protecting the real servers behind it, while defo.ie is the SNI of the actual
server.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-05-TLS_1.3_esni_and_ECH_advancements/defo-ECH-test-website.png">

Notice that the outer SNI is cover.defo.ie , but inner SNI is the real one defo.ie
In fact, as TLS1.3 ECH is ultimately designed to work with CDNs, so cover.defo.ie
represents the CDN client facing server SNI, which is typical the CDN server protecting
the real target servers behind it, while defo.ie is the SNI of the real server.
Now letâ€™s look behind the scenes to see the packet exchange:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-05-TLS_1.3_esni_and_ECH_advancements/ECH-wireshark.png">

In this exchange, we observe the HTTPS type 65 DNS record returned, highlighting the
most important fields within the ECHConfig, especially the Public Key to be used, the
cipher suite, and the Public Name.

Now that we peaked into DoH exchange, letâ€™s check the TLS1.3 ECH exchange:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-05-TLS_1.3_esni_and_ECH_advancements/TLS1.3-with-ECH-wireshark.png">

Key Points:

- The ClientHello and TLS version resemble a typical TLS 1.2 connection; however,
this ClientHello is actually the OuterClientHello. The presentation as TLS 1.2 is a
deliberate design choice to ensure backward compatibility for TLS 1.3 and to
avoid censorship. Other fields and mechanisms are employed by an ECH TLS 1.3
enabled client and server to recognize this as a genuine TLS 1.3 ECH connection.
This document focuses on web-filtering relevant fields and mechanisms.

- The SNI displayed is not **defoe.ie** but rather **cover.defo.ie**, the latter being in
clear text.

- The ALPN of outer ClientHello is also not encrypted, displaying everything as a
standard TLS 1.3 ClientHello without ECH.

Further inside the same packet, we find the encrypted InnerClientHello, ensuring the
real SNI and ClientHello are encrypted and secured.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-05-TLS_1.3_esni_and_ECH_advancements/TL1.3-ECH-Inner-Encrhpted-client-hello.png">

#### Next Generation Firewalls and TLS1.3 ECH

That being said, as of today without Man-in-the-Middle (MoM) decryption, as of today,
its not possible for Next Generation Firewalls or other network security devices to discern the actual SNI used

The current strategy involves blocking both DoH ECH type 65 resolutions and the
ClientHello that contains an encrypted ClientHello inside, indicating ECH usage. While
this approach may work with some ECH-enabled websites/browsers, like the one we
tested, a correctly implemented TLS 1.3 ECH extension will not be susceptible to this
sort of 'downgrade attack'.

This protection against downgrade attacks is known as anti-downgrade protection. It
functions by the server encoding and hiding its support for TLS 1.3 and ECH within the
first 8 bytes of the Random value. This signals to the client that the server truly supports
TLS 1.3 and ECH. A client with a well-implemented TLS 1.3 extension can detect an
attempted downgrade attack and terminate the session accordingly.

Therefore, the takeaway is that these measures are still undergoing testing and
refinement.

## QUIC and HTTP/3

### QUIC / HTTP/3 and ECH

HTTP/3 utilizes the QUIC transport protocol to enhance the limitations observed in
HTTP/2, notably reducing latency through connection-oriented multiplexing and
encryption. This helps in a more eWicient web experience by addressing performance
issues like head-of-line blocking inherent in its predecessor.

Despite these advancements, QUIC/HTTP/3, like TLS 1.3, does not initially encrypt the
SNI, prompting the later inclusion of ECH support.

Therefore , ECH support was also added into QUIC :

https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40211158

So same mechanism concepts we explained in this document applies to HTTP/3
exchange with ECH support.

### Next Generation Firewalls and QUIC/HTTP/3 filtering

As stated in previous chapter, since the ECH concept applies in exact same way to
HTTP/3 and Quic exchange, we will not dig into details into QUIC/HTTP3 for brevity of the document, as the DoH , ECHConfig, Inner/Outer SNI applies exactly the same to
Quic and HTTP/3.



## Raising awareness and future perspectives

As emphasized throughout this document, TLS 1.3 with ECH poses a considerable
challenge and signifies a major shift in conventional network security protocols.

Egineering teams are actively engaged in promising work, yet a complete and non-invasive solution to address ECH has not been finalized.

Thus, while awaiting the outcomes of these eWorts, it is crucial to explore other
innovative solutions, particularly those leveraging the advancements in machine
learning.

ENEA has undertaken some work in this area, although the eWectiveness of such
initiatives remains uncertain at this point. More information can be found at
https://www.enea.com/insights/tls-1-3-ech-how-to-preserve-critical-traWic-visibility-
for-enterprise-and-network-security-while-safeguarding-privacy

In the interim, invasive methods, such as Man-in-the-Middle (MoM) decryption, may be
necessary for comprehensive network security protection, depending on the choices
and specific requirements of individual organizations, as well as regulatory
considerations.

We are committed to continuously updating this document with any new changes or
advancements as they arise.
