# BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) Interactive Animation

Welcome to this interactive animation of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the protocol that makes internet routing possible. This animation will help you understand how BGP works, including:

- AS (Autonomous System) relationships
- BGP path selection process
- Route advertisement and withdrawal
- BGP attributes and decision process
- Policy-based routing

Use the interactive controls below to explore different aspects of BGP routing and see how routing decisions are made in real-time.

<div id="bgp-animation-root"></div>

## How to Use This Animation

1. Use the timeline controls to step through different phases of BGP routing
2. Click on different AS nodes to see their routing tables
3. Observe how route advertisements propagate through the network
4. Experiment with different scenarios using the controls provided

## Technical Details

This animation is built using React and D3.js, providing a dynamic and interactive way to visualize BGP routing processes. The visualization accurately represents:

- BGP path attributes (AS_PATH, LOCAL_PREF, MED, etc.)
- Route propagation and convergence
- Policy implementation
- Route filtering and aggregation

Feel free to experiment with different scenarios and see how BGP makes routing decisions in various situations.
